# DECIDE Project - DD2480 Assignment 1

## Overview
DECIDE is a Java-based project designed to implement and evaluate launch interceptor conditions (LICs) as part of a hypothetical anti-ballistic missile system. The project is structured into multiple Java classes that handle different aspects of the computation, with unit tests ensuring correctness.

## Prerequisites
- Java 11 or later
- Apache Maven (for dependency management and build automation)
- A Java-compatible IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jannikhoesch/DECIDE.git
   cd DECIDE
   ```
2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. Run the tests:
   ```sh
   mvn test
   ```

## Running Tests
To execute unit tests, use:
```sh
mvn test
```
This will run all tests under `test/java/` to verify correctness.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create an issue
3. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature references issue #{issue_number}'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`)
6. Open a Pull Request

## Way of Working  

We used our first meeting to agree upon our way of working, which we have written down in the first assignment report **“Meet your group”**. Then we started distributing the workload by creating Git issues together and assigning them evenly. Each group member was responsible for finishing their tasks in their own time.  

Especially in the beginning, most group members who had not worked with Git before in a similar project setting had challenges getting used to it. During the first week, after some experience, the problems decreased, and we started working efficiently both as a team and with our own tasks.  

Using the **Essence Standard Checklist**, we currently consider ourselves to be in the **“In Place”** state since using the tools is working properly, but we are still not entirely used to working with Git in this way yet, which causes some problems to arise from time to time. We believe, however, that more practice will optimize our way of working and that we are on a good path to reaching an efficient workflow.
